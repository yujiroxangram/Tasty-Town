# Tasty Town

This repository contains the source code for the "Tasty Town" application.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Contains the Spring Boot application for the backend services, including API endpoints, business logic, and database interactions.

## Getting Started (Backend)

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
* Apache Maven
* (Optional) Docker for database setup
* (Specify your database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yujiroxangram/Tasty-Town.git](https://github.com/yujiroxangram/Tasty-Town.git)
    cd Tasty-Town
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3.  **Build the project (if using Maven):**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    (Or run directly from your IDE, e.g., `TastyTownBackendApplication.java`)

The backend application should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.
